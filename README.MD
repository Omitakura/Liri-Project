# Foobar

In this assignment, I will be making Liri!  Liri is like iphone's Siri.  Except, while siri is a speech interpretation and recognition interface, Liri is a language interpretation and recognition interface.  Liri will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.  

## Usage

Node Liri.js (Will display all availible options.)

concert-this (Will search for all upcoming concerts for searched band.)

spotify-this-song (Will search for all songs relevant to searched song.)

movie-this (will search for all movies relevant to searched movie.)

do-what-it-says (will read the text in the random.txtfile and perform the command listed in the file.)
## Examples

Here are examples for you to view.

concert-this
